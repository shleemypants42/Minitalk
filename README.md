This project is about MINITALK YESSIR!!
This project is about a server and a client that need to communicate between each other using signal functions. There are specific functions allowed in order to make
this project work such as:
signal, kill, sigaction, sigemptyset, sigaddset.
The server should first display the PID (Process identification) to the terminal. Then, the PID should be the input of the client in addition to the desired string of
the user. the server should be able to display that string on the terminal.
